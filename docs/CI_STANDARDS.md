## Confidence Label Requirements

**ALL competitive intelligence reports, analyses, and discussions MUST include confidence labels:**

| Label | Meaning | Requirements |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| ✅ **CONFIRMED** | Direct quotes or verified information | Must include citation link to official source |
| ⚠️ **INFERRED** | Logical conclusions from confirmed data | Must state the basis/reasoning |
| ❓ **UNVERIFIED** | Industry assumptions or speculation | Must note "requires further validation" |

## Mandatory Disclaimer

Every CI report MUST begin with this disclaimer:

```
## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This report differentiates between the following:

✅ **CONFIRMED**: Direct quotes or information verified from official sources with proper citations.

⚠️ **INFERRED**: Logical conclusions drawn based on confirmed data points.

❓ **UNVERIFIED**: Industry assumptions that require further validation.

Including this distinction is essential to maintaining integrity and building trust.
```

4. **Tables** should include a "Status" or "Confidence" column
