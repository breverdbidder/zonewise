> **Strategic Framework:** Minimum Exceptional Product (MEP)

---

## Overview

This folder contains ZoneWise's go-to-market strategy and marketing documentation, built on two foundational frameworks:

1. **MEP (Minimum Exceptional Product)** — Be exceptional at ONE thing (95% accurate compliance checks) before being adequate at many things
2. **Lemkin AI Sales Transformation** — Zero traditional sales headcount, AI agents for customer acquisition

## Key Strategic Principles

### 1. MEP over MVP (Master Principle)

> **"We will be exceptional at one thing before being adequate at many things."**

| Decision | MVP (Rejected) | MEP (Adopted) |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Launch scope | 67 FL counties | 1 county (Brevard) |
| Accuracy target | 70% "good enough" | 95% exceptional |
| Feature count | Many, shallow | Few, deep |
| Expansion trigger | "Soon" | After 30 days at 95% |

**ZoneWise's ONE Exceptional Thing:** Real-time, 95% accurate zoning compliance checks via MCP.

### 2. Zero Sales Headcount (Lemkin Model)
- MCP marketplace = primary acquisition (40%)
- Content Flywheel = 5-agent engine (30%)
- AI outreach agent (20%)
- PLG/free tier (10%)

### 3. "Agentic AI Ecosystem" Positioning
Sells *work performed by AI*, not software. 10-15x revenue multiple vs 3-5x SaaS.

### 4. Training Data Moat
- Real ordinance data (189 districts, 17 jurisdictions)
- Zoning interpretation logic (encodes attorney knowledge)
- Query accumulation (network effects)

### 5. Content Flywheel (5-Agent Architecture)
$50/month vs $3,000+ agency • 95% automation • 0 human hours/week

## The One Metric That Matters

```
ACCURACY SCORE = Correct Compliance Checks / Total Checks × 100

Target: 95%+
Measurement: Weekly sampling of 50 random queries
Validation: Manual verification against municipal records

Everything else is secondary.
```
