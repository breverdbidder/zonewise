## Overview

ZoneWise's go-to-market strategy is built on three foundational frameworks:

1. **MEP (Minimum Exceptional Product)** — Be exceptional at ONE thing (95% accurate compliance checks)
2. **Lemkin AI Sales Transformation** — Zero traditional sales headcount, AI agents only
3. **Content Flywheel** — 5-agent autonomous marketing engine

## Key Strategic Principles

### 1. MEP over MVP
> **"We will be exceptional at one thing before being adequate at many things."**

| ZoneWise Decision | Choice |
|-------------------|--------|
| Launch scope | 1 county (Brevard) |
| Accuracy target | 95% exceptional |
| Expansion trigger | After 30 days at 95% |

### 2. Zero Sales Headcount (Lemkin Model)
Following SaaStr's proof: 20+ AI agents → 8-figure revenue with <10 humans

| Category | ZoneWise Agents | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Sales | 3 agents | $116 |
| Support | 1 agent (MCP) | $0 |
| Content | 5 agents (Flywheel) | $20 |
| Operations | 3 agents | $20 |
| **TOTAL** | **12 agents** | **$156/mo** |

**Result:** 98% cost reduction vs traditional sales team

### 3. Content Flywheel
Self-reinforcing growth loop: Queries → Content → Leads → More Queries

```
Agent 1: Content Generation
Agent 2: Content Distribution
Agent 3: Engagement Tracking
Agent 4: Conversion Attribution
Agent 5: Optimization Loop
```

**Cost:** $50/month (vs $3,000+ agency)

### 4. "Agentic AI Ecosystem" Positioning
Sells *work performed by AI*, not software. 10-15x revenue multiple vs 3-5x SaaS.

## The One Metric That Matters

```
ACCURACY SCORE = Correct Compliance Checks / Total Checks × 100

Target: 95%+
Everything else is secondary.
```
